# Integration Guide
Interested in using Wyvern to provide asset exchange functionality for your users?

You're in luck! Integrating Wyvern is:

- Permissionless: you don't have to ask us first
- Free: you don't need to pay anyone anything, and you can choose all parameters of the fee structure (no mandatory token usage)
- Easy: you don't need to deploy any additional smart contracts, and we provide basic Javascript libraries

Wyvern is live on the Ethereum mainnet, and all deployed versions have been subjected to third-party audit ([read the audit summaries](https://github.com/ProjectWyvern/wyvern-ethereum/tree/master/audits)).
