## Field Descriptions
All of the following fields must be present in an order. Some may have special sentinel values.
### exchange
Address of the *WyvernExchange* contract. This is a versioning mechanism, ensuring that all signed orders are only valid for a particular deployed version of the Wyvern Protocol on a particular Ethereum chain.
### maker
Order maker (who may be buying or selling the contract call â€” the maker/taker differentiation is strictly a matter of fees).
### taker
Order taker, if a specific address must take the order, otherwise the zero-address as a sentinel value to indicate that the order can be taken by anyone.
### makerRelayerFee
Maker relayer fee, paid by the maker to the relayer upon execution if this is a maker order.
### takerRelayerFee
Taker relayer fee, paid by the taker to the relayer on execution if this is a maker order, or the maximum such fee if this is a taker order.
### makerProtocolFee
Maker protocol fee, paid to the `protocolFeeRecipient` if this is a maker order.
### takerProtocolFee
Taker protocol fee, paid by the taker to the `protocolFeeRecipient` if this is a maker order, or the maximum such fee if this is a taker order.
### feeRecipient
Address of the relayer who will receive the fee.
### feeMethod
Method of fee calculation (see [this discussion](https://github.com/ProjectWyvern/WDPs/issues/6) for context).
### side
Side (buy or sell). Sell-side orders execute contract calls and receive tokens, buy-side orders purchase contract calls and pay tokens.
### saleKind
Kind of sale, `FixedPrice` or `DutchAuction`.
### target
Target address of call.
### howToCall
Call method, `CALL` or `DELEGATECALL`.
### calldata
Calldata (bytes).
### replacementPattern
Mask specifying which parts of the calldata can be changed, or an empty array for no replacement.
### staticTarget
Target for `STATICCALL`, or zero-address as a sentinel value to indicate no `STATICCALL`.
### staticExtradata
Extra data for `STATICCALL` (bytes).
### paymentToken
Token used to pay for call, or the zero-address as a sentinel value for special-case unwrapped Ether.
### basePrice
Base price of the order, in units of the specified `paymentToken`.
### extra
Extra parameter for price calculation, specifying starting/ending price difference for Dutch auctions. Could be used to specify minimum bid for English auctions in the future should those be implemented.
### listingTime
Order listing Unix timestamp.
### expirationTime
Order expiration Unix timestamp or `0` as a sentinel value for no expiry.
### salt
Order salt to distinguish otherwise-identical orders.
